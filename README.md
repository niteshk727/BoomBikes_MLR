## General Information
- BoomBikes - A US based bike sharing provider requires assessment on their dataset representing usage of thier bikes. The company has suffered dip in thier revenue due to the pandemic in recent times and is now finding ways to accelerate it's revenue post pandemic.

- This project helps building a model that could describe the same and factors contrubuting to the same. The project builds up a model that could help predict and expose insights on the same and provide supports to consider factors for the requirement.
